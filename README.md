[Demonstration Video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/xyGgWdEczZhh0kdaq2In)

This assignment asked us to create a README generator using node.js and the inquirer module. To begin, the user should fork this repository and pull. Then, open the terminal, navigate to the folder 'main', install node and its dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
```
in the command line of your terminal.
Once installed, using:
```bash
node index.js
```
will run the application. Users answer questions in the command line and a README.md file based upon those answers will be created.
