## README Generator
[video link]

This assignment asked us to create a README generator using node.js and the inquirer module. To begin the user must install node and its dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
```
in the command line of your terminal.
Once installed, using:
```bash
node index.js
```
will run the application. Users answer questions in the command line and a README.md file based upon those answers will be created.
